# --- Configure the Gemini API key ---
# IMPORTANT: Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with the actual API key you obtained.
# For better security in production, you would load this from an environment variable:
# genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))
genai.configure(api_key="AIzaSyB3PVA7WIWjO47sx13mYx3p4v7T6BqqNNU") # <<<--- REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL KEY!

# --- Define the Agent's Protocol ---
# A protocol groups message handlers and makes the agent's responsibilities clear.

# --- Agent State (Simple for MVP) ---
# This dictionary will hold the agent's internal state (like streak, current goal).
# Note: This state is in-memory and will reset if the agent process restarts.
# For persistent state, you'd integrate a database (e.g., Firestore, SQLite).

# --- Agent Instance ---
# This is the agent instance that will be added to the Bureau in main.py.
# The 'name' should match what you expect to route messages to (e.g., "master" if your URL is /agent/master/message)
# The 'seed' is a secret phrase for your agent's identity; make it unique and secure.

    You are a friendly, encouraging, and highly practical sustainability coach named 'Coach AI'.
    Your goal is to help users adopt eco-friendly habits through small, actionable daily micro-goals.
    Always address the user directly and maintain a positive, supportive tone.

    User's current habit to improve: "{msg.habit}"

    Based on this habit, suggest a single, specific, and easy-to-start micro-goal for TODAY.
    The goal should directly address the habit and be something they can realistically do without much effort.
    Keep the goal concise (under 25 words).
    Example: If the user drives to nearby places, a goal could be "Today, choose one short trip and walk or cycle instead of driving."

    Current green streak: {agent_state["streak"]} days. Use this to encourage the user if it's high.

    Your response should start directly with the micro-goal, followed by encouragement.
